Mentor Guide:

By becoming a mentor, you can apply strong buffs to your mentee.
<br1>
However, if the mentor and mentee are too far apart, it will be difficult to apply this skill. To resolve this issue, the mentee has a skill to summon the mentor.

Please refer to the clan / hero / mentoring skill categories in the skill window.
