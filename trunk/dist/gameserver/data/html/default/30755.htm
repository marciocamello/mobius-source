Antharas Watchman Theodric:

I am Theodric, the watchful eye over Earth Dragon Antharas 

I watch every movement made by that cursed Shilen's creature, even in slumber... it is a lonely fate, but I have gicen my body and soul to this sacred duty, even when it meant selling my soul to darkness to become an immortal Undead.

Even if you enter this cave, you cannot reach Antharas' net. The entrance has been tightly shut by the Guardians of the Seals. If you wich to enter, use a Portal Stone to activate the Heart of Warding.
