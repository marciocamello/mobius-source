! The Messenger of God Tipiya:

It is not a coincidence. We have long been waiting for ... We are waiting for a hero who will break
this vicious circle and bring peace ... A hero like you.
Let the heroes who have been resurrected with dark magic and turned into monsters,
will rest in peace. The case is a noble, because if you kill them, the souls of heroes will gain freedom.
