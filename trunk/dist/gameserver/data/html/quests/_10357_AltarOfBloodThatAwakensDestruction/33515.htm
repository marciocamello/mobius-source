! Agent Giorgio:

Forbidden Gateway, which say that there is sealed Elder - it"s not just old ruins. 
No one knows what"s going on behind them, because they are locked up for so long that no one can 
remember the exact date.

Members of an organization called Embryo, removed the Seven Seals 
absorbed by the gate, built there the refuge and are now trying to resurrect the Elder.
