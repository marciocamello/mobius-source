Nagel:
<br>
Thank you!
<br>
The pain will hopefully start to subside now... hopefully.
<br>
Listen, I have one more favor to ask. The other rangers 
all knew I was suffering the most, and were all looking 
out for me, *Celin* especially.
<br>
Could you tell Celin what's happened?I'd appreciate it...
<br>
