!Grand Magister Valdis:

Well done! We will make great use of the material that you and your clan brought back. What a tremendous feat, to capture and bring back that ferocious creature! As promised, I will spread word everywhere that the clan you lead brought down a *Tyrannosaurus.*

Could we possibly convince you to continue your efforts on our behalf?
