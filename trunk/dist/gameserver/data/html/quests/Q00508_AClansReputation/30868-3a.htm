!Sir Eric Rodemai:

Too bad! I need you to slaughter* Gargoyle Lord Tiphon *and bring me his Shard!

*As I told you before, you dont't have to kill her yourself!* There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! Just stand in a safe place an watch your Clan kill Palibati Queen Themis and then bring his Shard to me.
