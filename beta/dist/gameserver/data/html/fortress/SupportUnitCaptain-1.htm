The Talisman is both magical and mysterious. Once applied to your bracelet, you will be able to see its surprising effect for youself. Before I can give it to you, hower, you must prove to me that you are capable of responsibly wielding such power. Give me *10 Knight's Epauletes* and I will provide you the Talisman. <center>
