<html><body>Fallen Angel:<br>
Humans were actually created by Einhasad's chaos-loving mate, the dissipated Gran Kain. In pledging their allegiance to Einhasad, they have suppressed their natural desire for freedom and independence. They became pawns in a game beyond their understanding... I find the whole situation both ludicrous and sad. I cannot understand why Mother do such a thing, much less allow it to continue for so long.<br>
