Ah? So, the dinosaurs themselves contain some fragments of Gazkh?<br>
I suppose that is possible...if the ax was broken and the fragments were scattered by the force Shilen used to seal Sailren. The predator dinosaurs here have skin harder than iron -- I doubt they would ever feel the fragments embedded in their hides. In fact, the very power of Gazkh has probably greatly extended their lifespans. You who contain an ancient Elrokian spirit, you are the only one who can hunt those dinosaurs and bring back the Gazkh fragments. Choose now. Will you attempt to recover the fragments?<br>
