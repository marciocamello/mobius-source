<html><body>Blueprint Seller Shaling:<br>
Hello!
What can I do for you?
Do you need the blueprint for an extraordinary golem?
Sorry, but I have only ordinary ones left now. Recently, I completed a really great golem blueprint, but I accidently dropped it off of the bridge and lost it!
What a terrible loss!<br>
