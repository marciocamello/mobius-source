How much are you willing to pay?<br>
Hmm, you must be here on the orders of another.. No matter, In order to obtain Stabilized Ectoplasm, which is itself a rare item. In fact, I have need of it as well.. You have the look of an adventurer, so I will strike a bargain with you. Exterminate *the Mirror Ghost* and *the Mummy* in the *Forest of Mirrors* and you will be able to acquire *ectoplasms*. Thirty ectoplasms will produce one Stabilized Ectoplasm. Bring back *35* of the and give me 5. Then I will make you a Stabilized Ectoplasm using this remainder.
