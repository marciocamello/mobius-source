Pets help their owners in many ways.<br>
If your inventory is too small or you have exceeded the weight limit, you can have your pet carry some items. Just do not use them too often. Regardless of how they may be helpful.<br>
And again, be careful when your pet grows. Dead pets can be returned, but mind the time. If you do not raise your pet in <font color="LEVEL">24 hours</ font>, it will be gone forever. This is very bad.<br>
