<html><body>Separated Soul:<br>
He has his loyal subordinates, their group is called *Wings of Sand*. They are preparing the attack simultaneously so it'll be hard to defeat them. But there's a way. Use Dragon Vortex to summon any of the seben of them: *Emerald Horn, Dust Rider, Bleeding Fly, Black Dagger Wing, Shadow Summoner, Spike Slasher, Muscle Bomber*. Once you can separate each of them it'll give you a chance. I need you to kill as more as you can, but I can reward you for *one* of *two* monsters slayed.<br>
