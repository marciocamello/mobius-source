Hmm... A Deluxe Fairy Stone, eh?<br>
It shouldn't be very difficult to make... Let's see what ingredients you have brought... Coal, Charcoal... gemstones... silver and Toad Lord Back Skins... It's all here! If you will wait a moment. I'll make it now. Gemstone with base.. Polish with silver. Umm, from this angle it seems very similar to a Stone of Purity. What is this, "Then reprocess with Stone of Purity again."? Hmm, is that really necessary? Anyway...<br>
