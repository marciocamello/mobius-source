Wait here a moment, please... Mr. Sorint! Would you like a cup of tea? Do you need anything? Very well! Please come this way... That doddering old fool! I'm surprised he hasn't fallen off a cliff by now... Have you brought me any Jade Crystals? What's with the empty hands? Have you been to the *Enchanted Valley* and met any *forest runners, fline elders, liele elders or valley Treant elders*?<br>
