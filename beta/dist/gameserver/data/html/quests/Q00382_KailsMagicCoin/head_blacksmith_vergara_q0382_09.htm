<html><body>Head Blacksmith Vergara:<br>
Although I've only just joined, I already know all of our members by heart!<br>
Let's see, there's *Magister Page* of the Magic Guild in Hunters Village, *Researcher Lorain*, who can be found near the entrance of Cruma Tower, *Warehouse Keeper Hagger* and *Guard Stan* of Oren Castle Town, *Blacksmith Duning* of Hunters Village, *Trader Ralford* under the Ivory Tower in Oren Castle Town,* Head Blacksmith Ferris* in Aden Castle Town, *Warehouse Keeper Collob* in Giran Castle Town, and... hmm, oh yes! *Grocer Pano* in the plaza of Floran Village!<br>
Impressive, eh? But oh so much more impressive now that we have a royal member such as you, my lord!<br>
