Just a moment... Let me get my glasses... Now, what have we here, hmm... Oh my!<br>
This is the *lowest grade* porcelain I've ever seen! Look at the large crack on the side. Do you see it? The texture is very crude, made from coarse clay... Sorry to disappoint you, but it is practically worthless...
