<html><body>Giant's Minion Hadel:<br>
The legs of Hermuncus have also broke into small pieces. But luckily, I found a wizard who can bring back the arms and legs of Hermuncus to their original state. It is *Maestro Ishuma*. He just restore the fossilized limbs of Hermuncus. Will be as good as new. Heir of the force of Giants, we must hurry. Take the fossilized limbs of Hermuncus to *Maestro Ishuma*. Of course, I am ready to pay him for the job. The main thing is that he will restore the body of the Lord.
