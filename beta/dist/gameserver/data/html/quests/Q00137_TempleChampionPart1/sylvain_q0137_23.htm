We will now, based on the inspector's report, write a manifesto setting out the Temple's legitimacy and authority. We will then send it to the groups opposed to us. In doing so, we will offer them a final chance to repent for forsaking us, and return to our loving fold... None of this would be possible without the document you recovered. Excellent work! You have already justified my faith in you. I know your efforts will not go unrewarded, either in this life or the next.<br>
