Once you have shared with me water, which was probably not easy to get, I'll help you. But I can not send you straight to Nerupe... I'll send you to Anghel Waterfall, which leads to Magmeld. Going into the cave under Angelic Falls, you will find a Gatekeeper Rukh.<br>
Ask her to send you a hug ..<br>
