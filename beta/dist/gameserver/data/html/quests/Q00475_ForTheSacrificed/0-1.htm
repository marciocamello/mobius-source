Any adventurers dyung to visit the Blazing Sawmp? Wait, I read that wrong... plan on dying when you visit the Blazing Swamp. <br>
Everyone knows the tale of the legendary battles that took place in the Blazing Swamp when King Amadeo`s armies destroyed their enemies during the Aden Elmore Wars. While they saw victory, many died and found their final resting place withing the lava filed swamp. <br>
Now the swamp is filed with creatures preventing those who wish to pay their respects to the fallen heroes. <br>
