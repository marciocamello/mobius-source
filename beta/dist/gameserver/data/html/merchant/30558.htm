For the eternal glory of the flame! Hello, brother of the flame!<br>
How may I serve you? Please survey my wares. You'll find that I carry nothing worthless in my shop. Just tell me whatever you need. There is nothing that I cannot obtain! It's an old maxim that adventure requires preparation. Without it, defeat and shame await you! Even we, the noble Orcs, may be harmed by the lowly beasts of the field unless we are prepared. Ha ha ha!<br>
