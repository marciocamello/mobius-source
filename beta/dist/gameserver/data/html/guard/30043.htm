<html><body>Guard Johnstone:<br>
Since I was young, I have idolized Mystics and wanted to study at *Einhovant's School of Wizardry,* but unfortunately the teachers there told me I had no magical talent. Now I realize that my physical strength is where my true gifts lie. In the end, I ve become a guard, and I don t regret it.<br>
