<html><body>Sentinel Veltress:<br>
May the blessing of moonlight be with you... My name is Veltress, one of the sentinels. We are called the watch of the forest. If you cross the bridge you see here, you can follow the road to *Lake Iris.* Legend has it that the lake was formed from the tears of the goddess Eva.<br>
