I suppose our village looks peculiar to outsiders. It's divided into three sections. The castle has an upper and lower level. The upper level consists of a *clan hall and the Temple of Einhasad*. The lower level features the *Library of Sages* and a *Combat Training Camp*. Just in front of us is our latest development! It's our commercial district, with *Dwarven stores, blacksmith shops and warehouses*.<br>
