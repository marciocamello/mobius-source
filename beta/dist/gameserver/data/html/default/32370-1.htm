Yes, Naia. It's the Highest and the most dangerous tower among all!<br>
It's the lair of Beleth. You will need to get to the top of this tower in order to access the roof of Naia's tower. But first you will meet Darion - the captain Guard of Beleth. He's tough emeny, but only defeating him will let you access to the Naia.<br>
