<html><body>Event Manager Buzz the Cat:<br>
Welcome! I am Buzz, the faithful cat of Magus Ahulon Raulian!<br1>
My master, one of the wisest of the Ivory Tower, is cautious with his affections. Recently he has quarreled with his lady love and she is quite upset.<br1>
She was so impressed the last time he collected one million hearts for her, he has vowed to do it all over again!<br1>
I, along with my master's other cats, have been holding the *Throb, Throb, Rock-Paper-Scissors Event* in all of the villages!<br>
