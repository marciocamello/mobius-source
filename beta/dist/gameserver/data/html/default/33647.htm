<html><body>Kartia Researcher:
<br>
I am a researcher dispatched from the Kingdom of Aden, and I've found that evil creatures from otherworldly dimensions are swarming over to our world under Shilen's orders! They plan to invade the Aden continent through Kartia's Labyrinth. My research group is looking for brave heroes who will stand with us to fight back!
