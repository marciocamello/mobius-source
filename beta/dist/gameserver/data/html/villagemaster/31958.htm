<html><body>Warehouse Chief Yasheni:<br>
Welcome, friend! Ah, I consider anyone who's been to my store even once a friend. That's how it should be, eh?<br>
Don't worry about that item. I will take excellent care for it for you. Even in the unlikely event that a thief should penetrate the inmost recesses of our warehouse, he will never lay a hand on it, of that you can rest assured! I, the Dwarf Yasheni, swear it on my father's beard!<br>
