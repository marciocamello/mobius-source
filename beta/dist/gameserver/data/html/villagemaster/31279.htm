I am glad to meet a talented young person like yourself during these troubled times. I am High Priest Gregory.<br>
As you know, Goddard is all abuzz these days with rumors of war between the Varka Silenos and the Ketra Orcs, as well as news of the recent awakening of the fire dragon, Valakas. The strength of young warriors like you is desperately needed in these anxious days.<br>
