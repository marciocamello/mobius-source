!Head Researcher Sobling:

As leader of the research team i'm looking for experienced adventurers to join us. Actually we're searching for relics from the ancient Giants Culture.
There are four scripts we can't find yet: *Plans for the construction of Golems, Basis of the Giant's Magic, Construction Technology Handbook and Giant's Medical Theory.*

Given the value of the items we're looking for, there is no need to tell you how generous shall be my rewards.
