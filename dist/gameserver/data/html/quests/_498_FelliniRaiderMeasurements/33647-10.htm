And, just received a message from the Captain of Aden Vanguard Adolf. You seem perfectly managed. We, do not often see the hero who could be entrusted with such a service. Thank you very much! <Br1> If you can, come back tomorrow to help us free the Kartia Labyrinth from demons. And this is a little appreciation from our kingdom.
