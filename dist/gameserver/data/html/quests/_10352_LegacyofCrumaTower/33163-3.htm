! Linkes:

So, I explain to you the task. I"ll give you a <font color="LEVEL">device treasure hunt</font> 
with which you have to find <font color="LEVEL">Suspicious mechanisms.</font> 
Then you should move to the upper floor of the Tower Marshlands. If you kill 
<font color="LEVEL">Martesa</font> and eject it from the body <font color="LEVEL">core of Martesa,</font> 
you can come back.

Why? Do not you understand? It seemed to me that there is no need for a long explanation ... Anything you do not understand? 
If so, do not hesitate to ask.
