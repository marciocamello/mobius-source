Initially, about your pet - a wolf. So you need to know something about the wolves.<br>
Wolves are <font color="LEVEL">carnivorous mammals of the family of dogs</font>. This class is very diverse, including dogs, raccoons, foxes, jackals. We do not know the life expectancy of wolves in the wild, but in captivity they live 12-15 years.<br>
That's all I had to say. If you are interested in something else go to <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font> and learn from <font color="LEVEL">Guard Brynn</font>.
