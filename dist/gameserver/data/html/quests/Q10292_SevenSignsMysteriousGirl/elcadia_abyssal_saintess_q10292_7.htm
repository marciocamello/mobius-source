Abyssal Saintess Elcadia:

My request is simple. You should be with me as long as I do not find the information you need. I was just looking for an assistant who could be trusted. Now I need to find out all about the Embryo. I do not know what it is - a person, place, or anything else ... But the job is received, and I need it to perform.
