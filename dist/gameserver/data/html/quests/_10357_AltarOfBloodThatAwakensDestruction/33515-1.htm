! Agent Giorgio:

Members of the Embryo removed Seven Seals, absorbed by the gate, and are now trying to revive the Goddess of Destruction. 
For the forbidden gate they erected a huge altar, which absorbs the blood, 
collected in the Necropolis and Catacombs, and to help resurrect Shilen reborn. 
They call it the altar <font color="LEVEL">Altar of Shilen.</font>

If left unchecked, will soon Elder finds its former strength, and bring in 
the destruction of this world, which we can not even imagine. Dusk 
now collect heroes to help stop the Embryo. Do not you want to help our intentions?
