! Liey:

We want to explore the connection between Elder and present the great disasters. For this purpose, we need to investigate
<font color="LEVEL"> the Tower of Insolence </ font>, which is confined to the gods who challenged Baium. However, our organization
operates in secret, so that we can not openly do research.

For this reason, we are recruiting mercenaries who can do the work for us. Of course, Krumas
guarantee reward, so on your part will not be any loss.
